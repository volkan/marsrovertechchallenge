Development Diary:

The Mars Rover Technical Challenge was prototyped using AS3 and Flash Builder 4 as a way to visualize the problem. 
(See "MarsRoverSample (AS3).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using Ruby on Rails 2.3.8 using the algorithms that were
developed during the AS3 prototype effort; one minor bug was fixed from the AS3 code however the original AS3 code
was left untouched for comparison.  The toolchain used for this was Ruby 1.8.7 with Rails 2.3.8 and Aptana 2.0; 
NetBeans 6.8 proved to be to much of a hassle to use it.  Notice the command that runs some hand-coded Unit Tests,
"ruby script/tests"; this was done to demonstrate how Ruby can be used to code Unit Tests.
(See "MarsRoverSample2 (RoR 2.3.8+jQuery).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using JavaScript and jQuery and aligned with the Rails 2.3.8
effort to allow both to coexist on the same web page for comparison purposes. The toolchain used for this was 
Ruby 1.8.7 with Rails 2.3.8 and Aptana 2.0 along with the latest jQuery and some JavaScript code I had sitting on
my shelf from 2003.
(See "MarsRoverSample2 (RoR 2.3.8+jQuery).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using Python 2.5.5.7 as a command line demo.  The toolchain for this
was the Wing IDE 3.2 and Python 2.5.5.7.  The JavaScript version was ported to Python by making changes as applicable
to make the JavaScript code into Python code.
(See "marsRoverSample (Python 2.5.5.7).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using Stackless Python 2.5.2 using the original Python 2.5.5.7 code
without modification.  The toolchain for this was the Wing IDE 3.2 and Stackless Python 2.5.2.  
(See "marsRoverSample (Stackless Python 2.5.2).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using PHP 5.3.2 using the Zend Community Server 5.0.1 
and Zend Studio 7.2.0.  The Ruby on Rails code was ported to PHP by porting over the HTML portions then the JavaScript
version was translated to PHP code.
(See "MarsRoverSample2 (PHP 5.3.2+jQuery).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using Lua 5.1.4 using the Lua for Windows toolchain by porting 
the JavaScript version to Lua.
(See "MarsRoverSample (Lua 5.1.4).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using C# 2008 using the Visual Studio 2008 toolchain by porting 
the JavaScript version to C#.  A complete set of Unit Tests were coded as in-line C# code.
(See "MarsRoverSample (VS2008 C#).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using VB using the Visual Studio 2010 toolchain by porting 
the C# version to VB.  A complete set of Unit Tests were coded as in-line VB code.
(See "MarsRoverSample (VS2010 VB).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using Active Perl 5.10.1.1007 using the Komodo editor by porting 
the JavaScript version to Perl.  A complete set of Unit Tests were coded as in-line Perl code.
(See "MarsRoverSamplePerl (ActivePerl-5.10.1.1007).zip").

Then the Mars Rover Technical Challenge was recoded using FreeBASIC 0.20 using the FBide by porting 
the VB.Net version to FreeBASIC.  A complete set of Unit Tests were coded as in-line BASIC code.
(See "MarsRoverSample (FreeBASIC 0.20).zip").
